# HangfireDemo1
.net core 6 asp.net demo of using hangfire


# NOTES #   

1 - VS2022 Community Edition was used to create the solution file so its best to use that rather than VS2019

2 - This demo is intentionally kept very basic.
So you have sometimes have to refresh the page after adding a job to see it on the processing list.
Also, if you just run the project in debug in VS2022 you should keep an eye on the console output to better understand whats going on.

# SETUP #

You will need to create an empty SQLExpress database named HangfireTest before the first run.
